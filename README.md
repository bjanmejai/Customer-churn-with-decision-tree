# Customer-churn-with-decision-tree


The modeling objective is to build and test a decision tree model that uses banking data to predict whether a customer will churn. If a customer churns, it means they left the bank and took their business elsewhere. If we can predict customers who are likely to churn, we can take measures to retain them before they do. These measures could be promotions, discounts, or other incentives to boost customer satisfaction, and, therefore, retention.
